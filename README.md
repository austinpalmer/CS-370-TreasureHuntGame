# CS-370-TreasureHuntGame
This is a treasure hunt game that involves training an AI agent to make the best possible decisions to solve the game.

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I developed the Q-training algorithm to make an AI agent determine the best move by analyzing Q-values and solving the issue through exploration and exploitation. The treasurehuntgame.ipynb file shows the code that was written by me (under the Q-training code) while the other files and code were provided to build the agent using Keras.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
Computer scientists find solutions to problems using computers. This could be through devleoping software such as an app or website for a business, developing an AI agent to learn to play a game, analyze trends and solve problems in data science, and much more. I approach problems as a computer scientist by first thinking through the problem, then desinging a solution through documentation and diagrams, then incorporating that solution in code, and finally maintaing that code and keeping it safe. My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization include making data safe and using it only when necessary, keeping the application safe as to avoid virusues, malware, and other dangerous software, and ensuring that my application brings no harm to human life.
